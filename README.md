# Bikeshare
My Udacity project. through this project I have used python programming language and their packages to analyze the data of bikeshare in 3 main cities in USA Washington, New York city and Chicago.
data analysis provides a good image about most frequent times and most frequent stations.
one of the main challenges which I faced in coding is how to handling errored that come from user input 
depending in this analysis, you can make plan to distribute bikes all over these cities 
this code can be simply run through any integrated development environment tool like spider, PyCharm or through jupyter notebook
